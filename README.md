#### Topic
Community Cooperation: Community cooperation is critical in maintaining steady headspace and a calm environment during a panic; and it’s easier said than done. During such a crisis, it is imperative to help one another. Developing solutions to assist in this area are integral in dealing with a pandemic.

#### Problem 
In this COVID-19 pandemic which has affected 213 Countries and Territories, the common folks are facing an ample amount of problems with the constant fear of catching the virus. Even for containment of the virus issuing lockdown has been a well-prepared strategy by the government but one of the major problems one might face in this total lockdown situation is the availability of shops and the probability of exposure at their regulars. With only a few shops/general stores available there is a chance of the place getting crowded and unsafe for the shoppers and the shopkeeper.

#### Overview of the Our Idea

TeamAham has devised an app that uses the users’ current location and enables them to view the shops/services available within their reach and also shows the traffic and gives an estimate of how safe that location can be and in store how many people are there so that not more people will go to that shop and that will help in encouraging Social - Distancing .Thanks to the IBM services and Here Maps, it has enabled us to come up with a solution for the same.
